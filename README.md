## What is Project-Purple?

Project-purple is a project that I made for School. It's based on the C# and the main goal is to make mini games using
Windows Forms. We had a lot of suggestions for the games, has the famous "Snake" or "Pong". I decided to make a
platformer.

## Why a platformer?

I chose a platformer because I like this kind of games and I think it's one of the first types of games that I played.
I also think it's a good way to introduce myself to the game development, as it needs level design, sprites, animations,
collisions, etc.

## Theme

There is not a specific theme for the game, but the menu assets and the character are based on the "Fire Emblem Three
Houses" game. <br> But there is also some sprites from the Mario or Zelda franchise.

## Main difficulties encountered

While making this game, I encountered a lot of difficulties.<br>
But by far the most difficult part was the collisions. It took me a very long time to make them work properly.<br>
I also had a lot of difficulties with the animations, but I managed to make them work.

## Potential improvements

For me there are two major things that I would like to improve in this game. The first one is by using more classes (for
example for the enemies).<br>
The second one is by adding more levels and more enemies. This would make the game more interesting and add more utility
to the life counter.<br>
And if possible I would also like to add more animations and more power ups.
